# data-structures
Implementation of different data structures using C++

## DSU(Disjoint Set Union)
Supports all the necessary DSU operations and also includes special merge and find operations which are revertible by inbuilt stack implementation.

## Directed Graph(Unweighted)
Currently supports all the required functions to construct the graph and most famous Strongly connected component algorithms(Tarjan's and Kosaraju's). Also contains inbuilt toposort function.

## Explicitly Indexed Treap (with multi-element support)
Treap implementation of std::multiset and contains extra features and much more flexible than the STL counterpart such as nth_element and sum of first n values for now.

## Explicitly Indexed Treap
Treap implementation of std::set. The function names were made pretty close to STL counterpart for easy use and has extra features like nth_element and sum uptop nth_element as of present.

## Implicitly Indexed Treap
Very powerful treap implementation of array with O(logN) expected time complexity for a whole range of complex manipulations such as range queries(sum,min,max), arbitrary range reversals, arbitrary range updation and single element insertion,removal, all online.
